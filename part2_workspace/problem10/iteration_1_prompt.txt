Improve branch coverage for this array transformation function with exception handling:

Current: 92.2% line, 78.1% branch (21.9% gap)

Canonical implementation (20 lines): Filter 1-9, sort descending, map to words via dict lookup with try-except
```python
def by_length(arr):
    dic = {1: "One", 2: "Two", 3: "Three", 4: "Four", 5: "Five",
           6: "Six", 7: "Seven", 8: "Eight", 9: "Nine"}
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    new_arr = []
    for var in sorted_arr:
        try:
            new_arr.append(dic[var])
        except:
            pass
    return new_arr
```

Generate 5-7 pytest tests covering:
- Empty array
- Valid range (1-9): single, multiple, duplicates
- Out of range: 0, 10+, negatives (triggers exception path)
- Mixed valid + invalid: [2, 10, 1, 14] → ["Two", "One"]
- Sorting verification: [2, 1, 5, 3] → ["Five", "Three", "Two", "One"]

Focus on exception handling path and dictionary lookup branches.
